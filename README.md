# Role Of Machine Learning In Detection Of Breast Cancer
The aim of this project is to develop a robust and accurate machine learning model for the classification of breast cancer diagnoses into two categories: "malignant" and "benign." Breast cancer is a significant public health concern, and an effective classification model can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions about patient treatment and care.

# Facts And Figures
Breast cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer in women and the second most common cancer overall. There were over 2 million new cases in 2018.

Prevalence

Asia
Percentage of world population: 59 Percentage of new breast cancer cases: 39 Percentage of breast cancer deaths: 44

Africa
Percentage of world population: 15 Percentage of new breast cancer cases: 8 Percentage of breast cancer deaths: 12

U.S. and Canada
Percentage of world population: 5 Percentage of new breast cancer cases: 15 Percentage of breast cancer deaths: 9


# Objective:
The primary objective of this project is to create a predictive model that accurately distinguishes between malignant and benign breast cancer diagnoses based on relevant features extracted from medical imaging data and patient information.

# Expected Outcome:
By the end of this project, we anticipate having a highly accurate and efficient breast cancer classification model that can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions regarding patient diagnosis and treatment. The model's ability to distinguish between malignant and benign cases will contribute to improving patient care and outcomes.

# Impact:
The successful development and implementation of this breast cancer classification model have the potential to significantly impact the field of medical diagnostics. Accurate and timely identification of breast cancer types can lead to more effective treatment strategies, reduced medical costs, and improved patient survival rates.
